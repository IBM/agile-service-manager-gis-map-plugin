## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repository via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please follow the bug instruction under [Issues](#Issues)
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- This project is an example of how a mapping solution could be implemented, we are not actively working to add new functionality to the project. However we are happy to make sure bug issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- Enhancements to the project will be assessed, but will require contributions to help implement specific functionality. 

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the project, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue please ensure it has one of the following labels.

- **bug** : This should cover any issue or security vulnerabilities reports. Please ensure you provide a clear description of the problem. This should include any specific configuration and the versions of the product being used.

-  **enhancement**: This is for a new feature or request, please provide details of the requirements and possible solutions if relevant. 

-  **documentation**: This is for a docs request to better clarify specific on using the project

-  **question**: This is for general help or questions about the project

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. This can also helpful indicator to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement into the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Add unit tests for fixed or changed functionality.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation update to the [README.md](README.md).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
